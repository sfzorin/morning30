# morning30.com

A mobile-first PWA for a **30-day morning-exercise** habit: a daily floor-and-mat
routine you can run with the screen in your pocket, guided entirely by voice.

- **Repository:** <https://github.com/sfzorin/morning30>
- **License:** [Apache-2.0](LICENSE)
- **Status:** active development

Each day is a single session — **warm-up → main block (×2 rounds) → cool-down** —
that grows from ~20 to ~30 exercises over the cycle, with lighter recovery days
mixed in. Progress, streaks and preferences are stored per user on the server.

Built with the [doors](https://github.com/doors-dev/doors) Go framework and its
GoX templates (server-driven reactive UI), a pure-Go SQLite database, and a
small client-side workout engine.

---

## Features

- **Named workout programs.** Ships with more than one built-in program (e.g.
  *Sergey* — floor/mat, no jumps; *Vlad / Level 2* — plyometric + cardio;
  *Ilya* — kid tennis, 0.5 kg dumbbells). Each
  is a 30-day plan with baked-in day-to-day progression. Adding another program
  is a single registry entry.
- **Universal difficulty.** A per-user level from **−3 to +3** scales every
  program by ±10% per step (reps and seconds only; breaths and warm-up/cool-down
  stay fixed).
- **Custom programs & exercises.** A full in-app editor (reorder, add, remove,
  retime) plus per-exercise JSON import/export. A user's custom exercises overlay
  the built-in library.
- **Two exercise types.** Reps (tap *Done*) and timed (countdown). Counts are
  shown as-is; the athlete does both sides of any one-sided movement themselves.
- **Voice-first player (client-side).** Progress bar, pause / skip / back, rest
  periods, screen wake-lock, and a celebratory finish (applause, confetti,
  localized encouragement). The player runs entirely in the browser from a
  server-provided JSON payload and reports completion back through a hook.
- **Spoken guidance** via the browser Web Speech API: a start cue, a rest
  announcement of the next exercise with its count, a 3-2-1 lead-in, a half-time
  marker on timed sets, and running technique narration (how to do it / common
  mistakes). Four levels in settings: off · minimal · normal · detailed.
- **Male / female figures.** Each exercise has a static illustration; a settings
  toggle picks the male or female variant.
- **Accounts.** Email + password (bcrypt). A **guest mode** lets people start
  immediately; signing up later upgrades the guest in place, keeping all progress.
- **Streaks & calendar.** Consecutive-day streaks and a monthly activity calendar.
- **7 languages.** Russian, English, Turkish, German, Spanish, French, Italian —
  UI strings, exercise names, and voice cues.
- **Installable PWA** (web manifest + service worker + icons).

## Tech stack

| Layer        | Choice |
|--------------|--------|
| Language     | Go (≥ 1.25) |
| UI framework | [doors](https://github.com/doors-dev/doors) + GoX templates (`.gox` → generated `.x.go`) |
| Database     | SQLite via pure-Go [`modernc.org/sqlite`](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite) (no CGO) |
| Auth         | bcrypt (`golang.org/x/crypto`), cookie sessions |
| Workout player | Vanilla JavaScript + Web Speech API |

## Architecture

The app is **server-driven** for everything except the workout itself:

- **Pages** (`segments/pages/`) — sign-in/up, home (today + calendar + streak),
  settings, and the router — are doors components rendered and updated on the
  server. A shared reactive `Session` value drives auth-gated routing.
- **The workout player** (`assets/player.js`) is the one client-side piece. The
  server builds a self-contained JSON payload (the day's items, localized labels
  and voice cues, the user's voice mode and figure variant) and hands it to the
  player, which owns all timing, speech, pausing and rest. On finish it calls a
  server hook to record the day and advance the cycle.
- **Layered exercise catalog** (`internal/catalog/`) resolves each exercise
  through three layers, the first match winning:
  `per-user custom → global DB library → built-in code`.
- **Content** (`internal/content/`) holds the exercise library and the named
  standard programs; a program is a shared warm-up/cool-down plus a per-day main
  block, flattened and difficulty-scaled at run time.
- **i18n** (`internal/i18n/`) holds all 7-language UI strings, exercise names and
  spoken cues.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**

- Go ≥ 1.25
- The `gox` CLI — a prebuilt binary pinned to the `github.com/doors-dev/gox`
  module version, kept in `.tooling/bin/` (it cannot be `go install`ed).

**Run**

```bash
./dev.sh run          # regenerate templates, then `go run .`  →  http://localhost:8080
```

`dev.sh` sets `PATH` and `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod` for you. Other commands:

```bash
./dev.sh gen          # regenerate .x.go from .gox (run after editing any .gox)
./dev.sh build        # gen + go build ./...
./dev.sh tidy         # go mod tidy
```

> Edit **`.gox`** files only — the `.x.go` files next to them are generated and
> overwritten by `gox gen`.

**Configuration**

| Env          | Default      | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| `MORNING_DB` | `morning.db` | SQLite database file path (the container points this at the persistent `/data` volume) |

The server listens on `:8080`.

---

## Building & deployment

A multi-stage [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) produces a small static binary on a slim
Debian runtime; [`deploy/docker-compose.yml`](deploy/docker-compose.yml) runs it
with a persistent data volume. Production deploys are automated via GitHub
Actions (build → ship → restart); the deployment **secrets, volume and DNS are
managed outside this repository** by the operator.

---

## Internationalization

All user-facing text is centralized in `internal/i18n` as `[7]string` tables in
the order `[ru, en, tr, de, es, fr, it]`. Exercise technique content lives in
`internal/content` per language. Adding a language means adding a column to those
tables and a `Lang` entry — there are no translation files to wire up.

## Leap Fitness How-To import

Offline tooling (in `scripts/`, Python) that builds an exercise catalogue from the
public **"How to Do …"** videos on the *Leap Fitness Official* YouTube channel.
No video is ever downloaded — only public titles/URLs are read, and all card text
is written **originally** in this project's house style (nothing is copied from a
video, description or subtitle). Every card carries its source video link and a
`review_status` for manual review before publishing.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

.venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_leap_howto_videos.py       # → data/leap_howto_videos.raw.json
.venv/bin/python scripts/enrich_leap_dates.py             # (optional) fill publish dates
.venv/bin/python scripts/normalize_leap_exercises.py      # dedup (keep newest) + match + group
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_leap_exercise_cards.py  # assemble house-style cards
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_leap_exercise_cards.py  # validate
```

Source preference: the **YouTube Data API** when `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is set
(`.env`), otherwise **yt-dlp** (metadata only). Card text comes from the authored
house-style pass; with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set the generator can fill any gaps via
OpenAI, else it uses safe generic drafts. See [.env.example](.env.example).

Outputs:

| File | What |
|------|------|
| `data/leap_howto_videos.raw.json` | every "How to Do" video found (title, URL, thumbnail) |
| `data/leap_howto_exercises.normalized.json` | unique exercises (freshest duplicate kept), grouped, matched to existing |
| `data/leap_video_map.json` | exercises that match the app's library → just attach a video |
| `content/leap_exercise_cards.en.json` / `.md` | the assembled cards (English) |
| `content/leap_exercise_cards.review.csv` | flat review sheet (`exercise_id,name,video_url,status,issues`) |
| `content/leap_exercise_cards.validation.json` | validation report |
